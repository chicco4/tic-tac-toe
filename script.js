/** 
 * Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible.
 * Try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory.
 * Rule of thumb: if you only ever need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController), use a module.
 * If you need multiples of something (players!), create them with factories.
